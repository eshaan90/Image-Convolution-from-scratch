# Image-Convolution-from-scratch
This project implements convolution of various filter kernels with an image using only numpy as dependency. It also implements the padding operation on the image before it is convolved.

Inputs:

  Image Output Shape= ['same','valid','full']

  Pad Types= ['constant', 'wrap' , 'edge', 'reflect']

  Kernel options= {1:'sobel',2:'laplacian'}

Output: The filtered image along with the new dimensions of the image.
